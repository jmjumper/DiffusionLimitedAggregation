# Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)
DLA is an algorithm that creates awesome structures that can theoretically be found in nature (in zinc ions, electrolytic solutions, etc..). <br />
The particles randomly move around, until they come in contact with already aggregated particles. These particles are referenced as nodes is this implementation.  <br />
<br />
You can play around a bit by changing the speed, node-amount and other options in the settings bar as shown below.  <br />
This is strongly inspired by Paul Bourke who has done <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/dla/">a paper on this</a>. <br /> <br />
